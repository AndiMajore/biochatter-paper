## Discussion

Reuse of generic open-source libraries

Guarantee robustness and objective evaluation

Open and sustainable models

Complex logic and chaining: future

While we focus on the biomedical field, the concept of the tool can easily be extended to other scientific domains by adjusting domain-specific prompts and data inputs, which in our framework are accessible in a composable and user-friendly manner.

The Python library to interact with LLMs, vector databases, and all other features is developed openly on GitHub (https://github.com/biocypher/biochatter), and can be integrated into any number of user interface solutions.
We develop under the permissive MIT licence and encourage contributions and suggestions from the community with regard to the addition of bioinformatics tool integrations, prompt engineering, benchmarking, and any other feature.
