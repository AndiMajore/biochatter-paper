## Methods

BioChatter is a Python library, currently supporting Python 3.10-3.12, and generally the three most recent releases.
ChatGSE is a web app based on the Streamlit framework (version 1.21.0, https://streamlit.io), which is written in Python and can be deployed locally or on a server (https://github.com/biocypher/ChatGSE).
It is mainly used for demonstrating the various applications of the BioChatter framework and API.
<!-- TODO update web app, preview -->
For an up-to-date overview and preview of current functionality of the platform, please visit the [online preview](https://chat.biocypher.org).
ChatGSE Next (https://github.com/biocypher/chatgse-next) is a modern web app with server-client architecture, based on the open-source template of ChatGPT-Next-Web (https://github.com/ChatGPTNextWeb/ChatGPT-Next-Web).
It is written in TypeScript using Flask and Node.js, and demonstrates the use of BioChatter in a modern web app.
All packages are developed openly and according to modern standards of software development [@doi:10.1038/s41597-020-0486-7]; we use the permissive MIT licence to encourage downstream use and development.
We include a code of conduct and contributor guidelines to offer accessibility and inclusivity to all that are interested in contributing to the framework.

### Remnants

These interactions are handled by a pre-programmed conversational “Assistant,” which dynamically orchestrates LLM agents with distinct tasks using a Python model chaining framework [@{https://python.langchain.com}].
Using vector database approaches, the user’s prompts can be further supplemented with information extracted from pertinent, user-provided literature (Supplementary Note [In-context Learning]).

For example, connecting to a knowledge graph of cell markers based on Cell Ontology [doi:10.1186/s13326-016-0088-7], the task of annotating single cell data sets can be automated and made more reproducible (Supplementary Note [Cell Type Annotation]) by abstracting the pioneering efforts of manually executed studies [@doi:10.1101/2023.04.16.537094].

Using the emergent strategies of in-context learning, instruction learning, and chain-of-thought prompting [@doi:10.48550/arxiv.2303.17580], this can enable causal inference on relationships between biological entities, for instance via protein-protein interactions (Supplementary Note [Causal Inference]), and automated validation of literature references provided by the LLM (Supplementary Note [Literature Reference Database]).
The ability to chain arbitrary types of models enables advanced applications, for instance connecting to visual modalities such as spatial omics.
