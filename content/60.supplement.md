## Supplementary Materials

In our Supplementary Notes, we explain the functions of our platform in more detail.
Please note that several of the mentioned features, particularly more advanced ones, are in early developmental stages.
For practical reasons, we divide our software into two distinct packages, the user interface (UI) component ChatGSE and the Python backend library biochatter.
For an up-to-date overview and preview of current functionality of the platform, please visit the online preview.
Both libraries are developed in Python (version 3.10), according to modern standards of software development [@doi:10.1038/s41597-020-0486-7].
We use Streamlit (version 1.21.0, https://streamlit.io) for the web UI.
We include a code of conduct and contributor guidelines to offer accessibility and inclusivity to all that are interested in contributing to the framework.
