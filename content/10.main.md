Despite our technological advances, biology and biomedicine continue to pose incredible challenges [@{https://www.bbc.com/news/health-65252510}].
We measure more and more data points with ever-increasing resolution to such a degree that their analysis and interpretation have become the bottleneck for their exploitation.
One reason for this challenge may be the inherent limitation of human knowledge [@doi:10.1016/j.tics.2005.04.010].
Even seasoned domain experts cannot know the implications of every molecule, be it metabolite, DNA, RNA, or protein, even in their own domain.
In addition, biological events are context-dependent, for instance with respect to a cell type or specific disease.
