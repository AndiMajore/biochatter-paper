## Main

Despite our technological advances, biology and biomedicine continue to pose incredible challenges (Gallagher, 2023).
We measure more and more data points with ever-increasing resolution to such a degree that their analysis and interpretation have become the bottleneck for their exploitation.
One reason for this challenge may be the inherent limitation of human knowledge (Marois and Ivanoff, 2005).
Even seasoned domain experts cannot know the implications of every molecule, be it metabolite, DNA, RNA, or protein, even in their own domain.
In addition, biological events are context-dependent, for instance with respect to a cell type or specific disease.
